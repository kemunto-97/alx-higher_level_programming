N-Queens Problem Solver

Usage: nqueens N

This program solves the N-Queens problem, which is the challenge of placing N non-attacking queens on an NÃ—N chessboard.

It prints every possible solution to the problem, with one solution per line.

Arguments:

N - An integer representing the size of the chessboard and the number of queens.

Exit Status:

1 - If the user called the program with the wrong number of arguments or invalid argument values.

Example:

$ python nqueens.py 4

.Q..

...Q

Q...

..Q.
